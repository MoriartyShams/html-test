Strange times we're living in, panic and hysteria<br>
Poor man learn the rich man don't care for ya<br>
Narcissist mindsets spread like malaria<br>
Sit back and watch the show, America!<br>
Britain split through fickle shit<br>
A government of hypocrites<br>
These counterfeit politicians sit<br>
In parliament, not adequate<br>
Needlessly bleeding resources all dry<br>
Turn a blind eye if it means a pay rise<br>
"Oh what a shame it would be I would die"<br>
If Number 10 Downing Street burned in a fire<br>
Only joking, only messing, don't be stressing<br>
I'm a peaceful adolescent, there's no need to be unpleasant<br>
Write my thesis in a rhyme scheme<br>
To analyze the brain<br>
While my fingers on the trigger of a money game<br><br>

 Oh rain, rain, rain, rain<br>
A storm, it comes our way<br>
And those who rise through distorted lies<br>
Poisoning the veins<br>
But we like to point the blame, blame, blame, blame<br>
It's easier to blame<br><br>
But point the mirror at ourselves<br>
We're all part of this old money game<br>
(This old money game)<br>
(This old)<br><br>
       
Money is a game and the ladder we climb<br>
Turns a saint into a sinner with his finger in crime<br>
I'll break it down for you motherfuckers line by line<br>
This is business economics in a nursery rhyme<br><br>

She sells seashells on a seashore<br>
But the value of these shells will fall<br>
Due to the laws of supply and demand<br>
No one wants to buy shells 'cause there's loads on the sand<br><br>

   
Step 1, you must create a sense of scarcity<br>
Shells will sell much better if the people think they're rare, you see<br>
Bare with me, take as many shells as you can find and hide 'em on an island stockpile 'em high<br>
until they're rarer than a diamond<br><br>
    
Step 2, you gotta make the people think that they want 'em<br>
Really want 'em, really fuckin want 'em<br>
Hit 'em like Bronson<br>
Influencers, product placement, featured prime time entertainment<br>
If you haven't got a shell then you're just a fucking waste man<br><br>
   
Three, it's monopoly, invest inside some property, start a corporation, make a logo, do it properly<br>
"Shells must sell", that will be your new philosophy<br>
Swallow all your morals they're a poor man's quality<br><br>
  
Four, expand, expand, expand, clear forest, make land, fresh blood on hand<br><br>

Five, why just shells? Why limit yourself? She sells seashells, sell oil as well!<br><br>

Six, guns, sell stocks, sell diamonds, sell rocks, sell water to a fish, sell the time to a clock<br><br>
Seven, press on the gas, take your foot off the brakes, Run to be the president of the United States<br><br>
Eight, big smile mate, big wave that's great Now the truth is overrated, tell lies out the gate<br><br>
Nine, Polarize the people, controversy is the game <br>It don't matter if they hate you if they all say your name<br><br>
Ten, the world is yours, step out on a stage to a round of applause<br>
You're a liar, a cheat, a devil, a whore <br>
And you sell seashells on the seashore<br><br>

    rain, rain, rain, rain<br>
A storm, it comes our way<br>
And those who rise through distorted lies<br>
Poisoning the veins<br>
But we like to point the blame, blame, blame, blame It's easier to blame<br>
But point the mirror at ourselves<br>
We're all part of this old money game<br>
(This old money game)<br>
(This old)<br>
